    "✨ Added Locales system you can easy put your own languages",
    "🐛 Fixed issue where multiple shops appeared in one shared menu — now each NPC/shop opens its own menu independently",
    "🧠 Menu titles now dynamically use the shop key name (e.g. ['BlackMarket Drugs']) instead of the global menu title",
    "🔧 Reworked OpenMainMenu() to take a shopKey argument, ensuring isolated menu contexts for each store",
    "🧱 Unique menu IDs are now created per shop (codex_main_shops_menu_[ShopKey]) to prevent overlap in ox_lib and menuapi",
    "🎯 Cleaned and improved NPC prompt behavior for shop-specific interactions",
    "🚀 Overall improved TrustShop modularity and future expandability for multi-shop environments"
